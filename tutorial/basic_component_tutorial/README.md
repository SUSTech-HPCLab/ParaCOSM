## ðŸ§© Component Overview

### `eigen_sparse_matrix.cpp`

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how to use the Eigen library to construct a sparse matrix and perform BFS (Breadth-First Search) traversal on a graph represented by a sparse adjacency matrix.
- **Use Case:** Useful for handling large-scale sparse graphs, such as those found in social networks or recommendation systems.

### `openmp_vector.cpp`

- **Purpose:** Shows how to use OpenMP to parallelize the initialization and processing of a `std::vector`.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for simple data-parallel tasks, such as batch data initialization or numerical computations.

### `pthread_vector.cpp`

- **Purpose:** Utilizes C++11 standard threads (`std::thread`) to fill a large vector in parallel, with manual control over thread workload.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for scenarios requiring explicit thread management, such as chunked data processing.

### `pthread.cpp`

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates concurrent execution of graph updates and query operations using multiple threads, with precise timing of operations.
- **Use Case:** Helps understand data structure manipulation and performance analysis in a multithreaded environment.

### `test_read_speed.cpp`

- **Purpose:** Benchmarks memory read speed for different data sizes, simulating the effects of cache and main memory access.
- **Use Case:** Useful for analyzing how hardware cache hierarchies impact program performance.

### `time_measure.cpp`

- **Purpose:** Provides macros for measuring code execution time at nanosecond and microsecond precision.
- **Use Case:** Essential for profiling and optimizing code segments that require accurate timing.
