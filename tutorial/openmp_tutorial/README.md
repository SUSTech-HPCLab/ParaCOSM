# OpenMP Tutorial: High-Performance Parallel Programming in C++

This tutorial repository provides a hands-on, in-depth exploration of OpenMP and related parallel programming techniques in C++. It is designed for learners and practitioners who want to master parallelism, thread management, and performance optimization on modern multi-core systems.

---

## üåü Overview

OpenMP is a widely-used API for shared-memory parallel programming in C and C++. This tutorial covers:

- The basics of OpenMP: syntax, configuration, and runtime API
- Advanced parallel patterns: fork-join, tasks, and thread pools
- Performance measurement and best practices
- Comparison with Intel TBB (Threading Building Blocks)
- Real-world code examples and practical tips

---

## üìÇ Directory Structure

- **Readme.md**: Main documentation and conceptual explanations
- **ThreadPoolDFS/**: Thread pool and parallel DFS (Depth-First Search) implementations
- **openmp_fork_join/**: Classic fork-join parallelism patterns and OpenMP constructs
- **openmp_task/**: Task-based parallelism and OpenMP task API usage
- **tbb/**: Examples using Intel TBB for comparison with OpenMP

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++11 or later
- GCC or Clang with OpenMP support
- (Optional) Intel TBB library for the `tbb/` section

### Compilation Example

```bash
# Compile a basic OpenMP example
g++ your_example.cpp -o your_example -fopenmp

# Compile with TBB (if needed)
g++ tbb_test.cpp -o tbb_test -ltbb
```
