# ParaCOSM: Parallel Framework for Accelerating Continuous Subgraph Matching

## Compile

Our framework requires c++17 and intel icpx with onetbb. One can compile the code by executing the following commands. 

```shell
make
```

## Execute

After a successful compilation, the binary file is created under the `build/` directory. One can execute CSM using the following command.

```shell
build/csm -q <query-graph-path> -d <data-graph-path> -u <update-stream-path> -a <algorithm>
```

where `<algorithm>` is chosen from `sj-tree`, `graphflow`, `iedyn`, `turboflux`, and `symbi`.



```shell
build/csm -q <query-graph-path> -d <data-graph-path> -u <update-stream-path> -a <algorithm> --max-results 1 --time-limit 3600
```

## Input File Format
Both the input query graph and data graph are vertex- and edge-labeled. Each vertex is represented by a distinct unsigned integer (from 0 to 4294967295). There is at most one edge between two arbitrary vertices. 

### Query Graph

Each line in the query graph file represent a vertex or an edge.

1. A vertex is represented by `v <vertex-id> <vertex-label>`;
2. An edge is represented by `e <vertex-id-1> <vertex-id-2> <edge-label>`.

The two endpoints of an edge must appear before the edge. For example, 

```
v 0 0
v 1 0
e 0 1 0
v 2 1
e 0 2 1
e 2 1 2
```

### Initial Data Graph

The initial data graph file has the same format as the query graph file.

### Graph Update Stream

Graph update stream is a collection of insertions and deletions of a vertex or an edge.

1. A vertex insertion is represented by `v <vertex-id> <vertex-label>`;
2. A vertex deletion is represented by `-v <vertex-id> <vertex-label>`;
3. An edge insertion is represented by `e <vertex-id-1> <vertex-id-2> <edge-label>`;
4. An edge deletion is represented by `-e <vertex-id-1> <vertex-id-2> <edge-label>`;

The vertex or edge to be deleted must exist in the graph, and the label must be the same as that in the graph. If an edge is inserted to the data graph, both its endpoints must exist. For example,

```
v 3 1
e 2 3 2
-v 2 1
-e 0 1 0
```
