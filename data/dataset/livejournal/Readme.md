# LiveJournal dataset

The LiveJournal dataset represents the friendship network of the LiveJournal online community, which had almost 10 million members. LiveJournal allows members to maintain journals, individual and group blogs, and to declare other members as friends. This dataset is widely used for studying large-scale social networks, group formation, and community detection.
