# LSBench

https://github.com/cqels/LSBench


Our Linked Stream Benchmark (LSBench)[1] published in an ISWC paper 2012 [2] has been used in several very recent ICDE[3], SIGMOD[4,7,10] SOSP[5], VLDB[8] and EDBT[6] papers related to streaming graphs, so, we have decided to put some resources in developing and maintaining the source code which was orginally hosted at Google code, https://code.google.com/archive/p/lsbench/ . This is the placeholder for the next release. If you need a direct support for LSBench, don't hesitate to contact me or create an issue in this repository.

We use the dataset from the repo:
